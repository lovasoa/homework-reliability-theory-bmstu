# Study of the reliability of a complex system

We have a system composed of three types of elements,
each having their own fail rate. The global system requires a certain number of
elements of every type to work. All types of element have they own repair time.

This python code uses numpy to model such a system, and compute its global
reliability as a function of different parameters.
